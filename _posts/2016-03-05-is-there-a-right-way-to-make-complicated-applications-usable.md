# Is there a right way to make complicated applications usable?

There are many professional-grade applications which possess very complicated expert-level capabilities. Examples which most people have heard of are typically in the creative arts field such as Adobe's entire suite on their Creative Cloud. These programs are used by professionals every day to complete extremely complex tasks such as creating visual effects for movies or encoding video. However, the average person, myself included, only ever use a small portion of the tools available to them when using expert applications such as these. So what is it exactly that makes some complicated programs more user friendly than others?

Software usability has seen a shift in recent years towards a more human-centered approach. The concept is not new, and is probably best summarized by R S Nickerson when he said "the need for the future is not so much computer oriented people as for people oriented computers'' in 1969 \[1\]. Having said that 47 years ago User Centered Design (UCD) is not a novel idea, but rather a growing and continually and improving concept. In brief UCD combines aspects from each of these fields: cognitive and social psychology, linguistics, mathematics, computer science, engineering, human factors and ergonomics, socio-technical systems design, scientific management, work, industrial, and occupational psychology, human relations, and organizational behaviour\[2\]. Figure 1 below visually demonstrates how each of these different fields relate to each other.
